	<h1>Miss Jane Marple</h1>
	<img src="img/miss_marple.jpg"/>
	<p> Miss Marple is one of the most famous detectives of all times.  She is an elderly, never-married, 
	well-to-do woman who solves the murders that happen and affect the people immediately around her.  Unlike
	other detectives, she has no need to solicit for business and does not regularly do consulting work - in 
	fact, much of her investigative process includes inviting her neighbors over for tea.  Interestingly enough,
	over the fifty year span in which Miss Maple was written about, her personality changed from that of a gossipping
	old maid to that of someone who genuinely cares about their community.  In Agatha Christie's autobiography, she
    addresses this matter, saying that Marple did not become warmer through time, but rather learned how to trust others.
    This starkly contrasts with the overarching development of Hercule Poirot, Agatha Christie's other famous detective, who slowly becomes
	more egotistical and attention seeking through the books to the extent that Agatha Christie herself wanted
	to stop writing his stories, altogether.
